# How to contribute
Feel free to clone this repository, the source is in [this link](https://github.com/bernatguillen/TheoreticalEcology/), change everything in the folder `_posts` (be mindful of the dates), add plots (in the `assets/images` folder), and send a pull request; I will check everything looks good and will update. To do this you need to know how to use `git`. `Git` is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

If you don't want to do all the modifications (or don't know how to use `git`) but you see a typo/error and want me to change it, open an [issue](https://github.com/bernatguillen/TheoreticalEcology/issues) asking me to add something and I'll do it to the best of my abilities.

When you contribute, please remember to add your name as a contributor in CONTRIBUTORS.md. Or, if you put an issue, I will add it myself.
