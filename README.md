# How to contribute
Feel free to clone this repository, change notes.md, add plots (in the "Images" folder), and send a pull request; I will check everything looks good and will update.

Or, if you don't want to do all the modifications but you see a typo/error and want me to change it, open an issue asking me to add something and I'll do it to the best of my abilities.

When you contribute, please remember to add your name as a contributor in CONTRIBUTORS.md. Or, if you put an issue, I will add it myself.
