# Day 7

The goal of today is to talk about problems that can happen in population control. Our population is going to be a vector \\(\mathbf{n} = (n_0,\dots,n_A)\\) where \\(A\\) is the maximum age (for example 120). We remember from last day that the model for population evolution is:
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
n_0(t+1)\\
n_1(t+1)\\
\vdots\\
n_x(t+1)
\end{array}
\right) =
\left(
\begin{array}{c c c c c}
f_0 & f_1 & f_2 & \cdots & f_x \\
p_0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & p_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 0 & p_2 &\cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots  & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & p_{x-1} & 0
\end{array}
\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c}
n_0(t)\\
n_1(t)\\
\vdots\\
n_x(t)
\end{array}
\right)
$$

This matrix is non-negative, irreducible, and primitive.
Theorem: If there is non-pulsed reproduction, \\(\mathbf{n}(t) \to \lambda^t v\\) where \\(\lambda\\) is the largest eigenvalue of \\(L\\) (the matrix) and \\(v\\) is the corresponding eigenvalue. We can obtain the characteristic equation of the matrix by looking at \\(n_0(t+1)\\).
$$
n_0(t+1) = \sum f_i n_i(t)
$$
$$
\lambda n_0(t) = f_0 l_0 n_0(t) + f_1 l_1 \lambda^{-1} n_0(t) + \ldots + f_A l_A \lambda^{-A} n_0(t)
$$

Thus

$$
1 = f_0l_0 \lambda^{-1} + \ldots + f_A l_A \lambda^{-A-1}
$$

This has only one positive root (the function if monotonically decreasing in the domain \\([0,\infty)\\)). The root is known as \\(R_0\\) (cue to infectious diseases).

In Hastings (p.33) we can see a continous time version of this (sometimes known as renewal theory). In that case instead of \\(\lambda\\) we write \\(e^r\\) where \\(r = \log \lambda\\). The model is (for \\(B(t)\\) the births at time \\(t\\)):

$$ B(t) = \int_{0}^{\infty} B(t-x)l(x)m(x) dx $$

Now if \\(B(t) = e^rt B_0 \\) we arrive to the equation:

$$ 1 = \int_0^{\infty}l(x)m(x)e^{-rx}dx $$
